PBF defs from https://github.com/openstreetmap/OSM-binary/tree/master/src

Problems I went through:
	tried using pbf and protocol-buffers libraries, didn't support groups (header also looked strange)
	then tried google's (bloated) library, also didn't work (complained about unexpected end reading 64-bit value)
	turns out I was using the wrong decompression algo, deflate -> unzip and switching back to pbf worked
		first tried this hypothesis by checking against raw_size
		note: The multiple levels of compression are insane! DELTA coding INSIDE zlib?
